# Dodecahedron-Light

Project Description:
  Light fixture in the shape of a dodecahedron that uses one-way-mirror technology to appear "infinite".
  This means that there are LEDs on the inside, and you can see inside the fixture yet the LED light
  becomes trapped inside.
  
Execution:
  This was acheived by laser cutting pentagons out of acrylic and adhearing a one-way-mirror privacy
  screen to the inside. Then, 3D printed brackets hold it together and offer a spot to house the LED strip.
  This was modelled entirely in CATIA, but to format the PDF to laser cut I used inkscape.
